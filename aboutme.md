Hello! My name is Joshua Melville. If you choose to participate in this study, it will be me that contacts you and conducts the interview. On this page, you can find out a little bit more about me.

I currently live in Leicester, which is where I am from originally. My family have worked in and around the social work profession for many years. My mum works is a social worker in drug and alcohol services, and my aunty and uncle have recently retired after working in disabled children's services. Being around them has encouraged me to care deeply about the challenges facing people with disabilities (particiularly as a result of changes in policy and reductions to funding), which is why I am conducting this research. This study is my DPhil (PhD) research (more about it [here](../aboutstudy/)).  

I am currently a student at the [Oxford Internet Institute](http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk), which is a department of the University of Oxford. My supervisor there is Dr. Bernie Hogan, who is known internationally for his work on personal networks. Before starting at Oxford, I was a student at the University of Manchester, where I studied Sociology and Politics as an undergraduate and sociological research methods as a postgraduate.

In my spare time I like to cycle and play music. I am also a very keen follower of Leicester City Football Club!
