Below you can find information about the study in a Q&A format. If you ask for a [participation pack](../info-pack/), you will receive additional information in print form.

#### What is the study?
My research is about trying to understand the role that social networks play in important decisions related to social care. ‘Social networks’ are just another way of talking about the people you know, and how both they and you are interconnected.

I want to understand how social networks might make a difference to how effective personal budgets are, and how they can be made to work better for everyone.

#### Who can take part?
In order to participate you must be:

- Over 18 years old
- Have full capacity to make your own decisions
- Using a personal budget to manage some or all of your social care needs

If any of the above are not true, you may not be eligible for this study. If you are unsure, please contact me by requesting a participation pack.

#### Who are you?
My name is Joshua Melville and I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford. You can find out more about me [here](../aboutme/).

#### Why are you interested in this topic?
I care passionately about highlighting the successes and failures of government policy, and about giving a voice to people who may feel that their opinions are under-represented.

I think that policymakers and government officials need better information about the experiences of people using personal budgets, and that existing surveys and studies have not always told the full story. I aim to address these issues.

#### How much time will it take?
If you participate, I will interview you using a special piece of software that I have developed. The interview will take between 1.5 and 2 hours.

#### What will happen during the interview?
During the interview we will be using a piece of computer software that I have created. I have designed it to be as easy to use as possible, so you don’t need to worry if you don’t think of yourself as being good with computers. It uses a touch screen to drag and drop icons around, and works a lot like a big iPad or tablet.

If you feel you will have difficulty with the physical movements, the software can also work with a keyboard and mouse, or with any specially adapted input devices you might have. As a final option, someone can help you to enter the information.

Using this software, we will create a “map” of who you know, and then use the map as part of an interview. During this interview, I will ask you questions about your personal budget and the people you know. I will record the audio of our conversation, so that I can keep a record of what you said.

#### What about my privacy? What will happen to the data you collect?
The information that you provide (including the network ‘map’ and the audio of the interview) will be encrypted and stored using very strong passwords on a dedicated research computer. Nobody other than myself will have access to the data at any time.

As part of publishing the research findings, I might need to use direct quotations from your interview, or display parts of your map as an example. If this happens, I will provide you with an anonymous identity, and will remove your personal data as needed. I will not reveal more information than is absolutely necessary, and I will be particularly careful not to reveal any sensitive information about you.

You will have the opportunity to say ‘no’ to any use of your data before my final thesis is submitted. I will provide you with a draft document along with a list of direct references to your data to help with this.

After the thesis has been submitted, data that can be anonymised will be submitted to the University of Oxford’s research data repository for sharing with other researchers. This process will be scrutinised independently to ensure that the data is safe to share. Any data that cannot be made appropriate to share will be securely erased.
